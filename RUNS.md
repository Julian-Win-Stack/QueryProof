# Run log

Append-only. One entry per eval run, written when the run finishes. **Never edit
a past entry** — locking the number is the entire point of this file. A run with
no entry here did not happen.

The numbers are the same ones evalite exported to `runs/<id>.json`. This file is
the readable mirror, plus the judgement the export cannot hold.

## Verdicts

- **kept** — valid run, beat the previous best by more than the noise band. The
  approach stays.
- **rejected** — valid run, did not beat the previous best. The number stands as
  evidence; the approach is abandoned. A rejected run is not a failed run.
- **void** — the run is not evidence: wrong configuration, crashed mid-run, a
  model other than `gpt-5.6-terra`, or responses served from a cache. The number
  is discarded and never compared to anything.

A number that changed by less than the noise band did not change. Two numbers
measured under different modes are never compared to each other.

## Entry format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <what changed>
approach:      mode=hard picker=llm repair=on prompt=v2 model=gpt-5.6-terra
question set:  dev-slice (100) | full (500 validated)
accuracy:      00.0% (n/denominator)
table recall:  00.0%
noise band:    ±0.0 points (3 trials, YYYY-MM-DD)
verdict:       kept | rejected | void
note:          what changed since the last run, and what the number says
